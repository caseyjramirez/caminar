                    Thank you for checking out Rambler. I created Rambler for my campstone project during my time at Flat Iron School.
                    The Rambler you are seeing today has come a long way.
                    Initially, Rambler was created to help software engineers find other engineers to go on walks with.
                    Today, Rambler has a much broader vision-to spread ideas through various forms of physical activity.
                </p>

                    <a href={playlistLink} rel="noreferrer" target={"_blank"}>Listen to the music that inspired Rambler.</a>
